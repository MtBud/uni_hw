# Homework Repo
Welcome! This is my Github repository that i set up, in order to back up and unify all of my homework and projects i did so far.
Most of the work here was assigned to me at ÄŒVUT-FIT university. Because of that, some pieces of code lack propper context and documentation. When i wrote the code, I didn't feel the need to include the assignment instructions, mainly because of their length. I can't add them retroactively, because I don't want to violate any school policies. 

### Contents
